#create the function explore, which takes a dataframe, a vector of bin sizes and a correlation threshold as input parameters. It then plots a pair of blue histograms(one count and one density) for each specified bin size, plots a gray bar graph for every categorical and binary variable, calculates the r^2 value for every pair of numerical values, and returns a list of 4. In this returned list there is a frequency table for every categorical and binary variable, a summary statistics table for every numerical variable, a dataframe consisting of every pair of numerical values and their corresponding r^2 value, and a dataframe consisting of every pair of numerical values and their corresponding pearson correlation coefficient.
